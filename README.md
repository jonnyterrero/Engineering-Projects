## 💡 The Story Behind These Stacks

This repository evolved from a simple question: *"Can you create a tech stack that includes MATLAB, Python, and whatever the best programs are for biomedical/mechanical engineering?"*

### Evolution Timeline:

1. **Comprehensive Stack (01)**: The first approach created an extensive collection of all the best tools - perfect for exploring all possibilities.

2. **Optimized Stack (02)**: When you asked *"I was thinking of making a tech stack with MATLAB, Python, and SQL? What else should I add to make an efficient stack?"* - we realized your core idea was brilliant! This focused version builds on your foundation with strategic additions.

3. **App Development Framework (03)**: Recognizing that modern engineers need to build applications, not just calculations, we added a complete full-stack framework for creating production-ready web and mobile applications.
